great3reredux v3
----------------
v3.yaml
v3deep.yaml
    - had bug (was sheared).  Matt is rerunning.
    I will want to redo priors

- max-v3d01
    - max like run to get priors
- mcal-v3d01
    - deep data
- mcal-v3s01
    - shallow data

    s1: 0.07996 +/- 0.00019
    s2: 0.00045 +/- 0.00017
    delta g/g = -0.0005 +/- 0.0024

# runs with gaussians
- max-g-v3d01
    - max like run to get priors
- mcal-g-v3d01
    - deep data
- mcal-g-v3s01
    - shallow data
    s1: 0.0800 +/- 0.0002   s2: 0.0004 +/- 0.0002
    delga t/g = -0.00059 +/- 0.00232

v04 in my directory
-------------------
can use priors from v3 for now

- max-v04d01
    - for prior
- mcal-v04d01
    running
- mcal-v04s01
    - shallow data

v05 larger sim, 20,000,000
--------------------------
- using deep run mcal-v04d01
    s1: 0.08007 +/- 0.00013   s2: -0.00006 +/- 0.00010
    delta g/g 0.0008 +/- 0.0017

    errors larger than I anticipated, may have to do with proper
    bootstrapping of the deep data. If I don't bootstrap the
    deep data as well, the frac error is 0.0007

v05deep larger deep sim, 1,000,000
- max-v05d01
    - for priors
- mcal-v05d01
    - priors from max-v5d01


great3reredux v1
-----------------

- max-deep01
    - v1 sims
    - max like run on deep data, no extra noise added
    - flat g prior  

- max-deep02
    - v1 sims
    - added g prior, but no better, will use deep01

- mcal-01
    - v1 sims
    - flux, flat prior spanning what we see in deep01
    - T, gmixnd with 1.1 cov factor

- mcal-degrade01
    - v2 sims
    - flux, flat prior spanning what we see in deep01
    - T, gmixnd with 1.1 cov factor
        - was not refinding center in the noisy image
        - also bug, wrong target_noise


- mcal-degrade02
    - v2 sims
    - flux, flat prior spanning what we see in deep01
    - T, gmixnd with 1.1 cov factor
    - this version finding cen for the noisy images, 
      and proper mean noise from shallow of 0.0877

- mcal-02
    - v2 sims
    - flux, flat prior spanning what we see in deep01
    - T, gmixnd with 1.1 cov factor
        - using mcal-degrade02
        s1: 0.0806 +/- 0.0008   s2: 0.0011 +/- 0.0009
        fracerr: 0.00706 +/- 0.00984

- mcal-03
    - v2 sims
    - same as mcal-02 but just testing with new code
    - flux, flat prior spanning what we see in deep01
    - T, gmixnd with 1.1 cov factor
        - exactlyl the same, good
